## Introduction

### What is PowerShell

Windows PowerShell is a shell initially developed by Microsoft for task automation and configuration management. PowerShell is now an [open-source project](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), and it can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This shell is based on the .NET framework, and it includes a command-line shell and a scripting language.
